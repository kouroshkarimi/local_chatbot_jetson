# Building a Voice-Interactive Chatbot with STT, TTS, and Local LLMs
We are building a voice-interactive chatbot that leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and local Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on Ollama's local LLM capabilities. This system will enable real-time conversations with users through a privately deployed, Dockerized setup, making it a versatile and secure solution for various applications. We hope the system has the following features:

#### 1. Speech-to-Text (STT) Module:
- Implement a high-efficiency speech recognition system to convert user voice input into text in real-time.
- Multilingual support is a significant plus!
#### 2. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Module:
- Integrate a natural and smooth TTS system that converts chatbot text responses into voice.
- Prioritize support for multiple languages, especially Chinese and English, with a focus on natural and emotionally responsive outputs.

#### 3.Local LLM (Ollama):
- Deploy a local LLM using Ollama to understand and generate text responses based on user voice input.
- Ensure the model operates efficiently with fast response times suitable for real-time voice interactions.
- Support context retention for understanding the logical flow of continuous conversations.

#### 4.User Interaction:

- Implement button-triggered voice input and termination, allowing users to easily control the start and end of conversations.
- Minimize latency in voice input and output to ensure a smooth interaction experience.
